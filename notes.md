# Notes & Important Conversations

## March 24, 2020
- Over the past week, I have personally reached out to many public health contacts, Ohio dept of Medicaid, 
Ohio Dept of Mental Health & Addiction services, the CDC and my own credentialing agencies. The healthcare 
system definitely was not prepared for the pandemic and it has thrust all healthcare workers into __HUGE__
situations of tough calls and discomfort. there’s many discussion to be had! 
- __Perhaps you may have some insight as to how we can help front line and social services people connect. 
It seemed to be along the lines of starting a separate slack channel.__ 

I think that the biggest problem right now is that many frontline workers are not being offered support 
whatsoever from their employers due to lack of readiness and the nature of the job. 
- __So would this be a way for frontline workers to connect to social services for their own health?__ 
I think it could be! Also making things more accessible for them ie bagged meals dropped off at the 
hospital building to be distributed to staff due to lack of time to pick things up.

  Any sort of support/morale boosting initiatives we could create in our community would be helpful 
  because many hospitals don’t have budgeted resources for it didn’t now. 
  
  Many people are uncomfortable with the lack of precautions/PPE equipment/expectations in my facility 
  but are stuck due to not being able to receive unemployment if they were to resign and needing to 
  take care of their families. 

  Healthcare companies are not in positions of providing support to their staff due to the crisis - 
  and I think many frontline staff would be grateful for anything we could do!
  - __So what people would we need to connect to be able to communicate effectively?__ 
  
  Twofold: 
  - Contacts to connect with organizations & businesses to develop the services for workers as well as 
  spread word for need.
  - Contacts within area facilities to notify healthcare workers of the availability! Most healthcare 
  workers are burnt out by end of day and do not have ability to go home and research or reach out for help. ESP in a crisis! 

  I’m lucky enough to drink a ridiculous amount of coffee I guess :zany_face:
  - I have some nurse manager and pharmacy friends with Ohio health and some other contacts in the area 
  we could contact to spread the word to frontliners once we begin to develop! 

  I’ve seen a lot of support group type connections pop up in my field across the US, but I think the biggest 
  need right now is providing support and comfort to frontliners who AREN’T receiving it from their 
  employers (which is the majority, unfortunately)  
  - A lot of the work happening right now in the group as a whole is end user focused (for the public) rather 
  than providers in the state. When I see things like this [tweet](https://twitter.com/DeepAshanaMD/status/1242229204948865025) 
  it 1) Makes me really proud of Twitter as still being awesome in emergencies :slightly_smiling_face:  
  but 2) makes me think that doctors and nurses have no network for sharing those types of questions/suggestions 
  internally even if they do have them. Or, maybe one hospital system does, but then the next one misses out.
  - Exactly!!! And for the most part, it’s not built into the business infrastructure to begin with. It’s designed 
  for efficiency and patient satisfaction, not employee support.
  - When I first heard this idea suggestion, I envisioned a private social network with groups and forums where providers could simply 
  talk to one another - tell each other what they're seeing, what they need, and where we listen for needs that our 
  community/cities/states might be able to fill.
  - Possible name "The Frontline"
